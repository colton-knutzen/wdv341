        <li><strong>1. Version Control Software</strong>: A VCS is a software that saves and tracks changes made throughout an application. It gives developers the abilities to collaborate, branch, and rollback to various points in development process.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Add</strong>: Add is the first stage in a VCS workflow. It's when the developers are adding files and changes to be included in the next commit.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Commit</strong>: Commit the the second stage. This is where all the added files and changings from the previous stage are saved into one instance of a "save point". But these are typically local repositories.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Push</strong>: Push is the final stage where developers make all the commits, or save points, onto the shared repository so other developers can see the changes.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Pull</strong>: Pull is a command that will update and fetch any changes made to files and include them into the local repository. It's like a realtime, automatic update when changes are made in external coding programes like VS Code.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Clone</strong>: Clone is when a developer requests the VCS to download the most current version of the shared repository. To bring it all together, let's say there are three developers working on the same site. Each add two pages throughout the day that gets constantly updated through Pull. Then commit those two pages to their local repository as a "save point". Then they push it to the shared repository. And finally, once everyone has pushed their work, they Clone the most current version so everyone now has 6 pages of the site.</li>
    </ul>
